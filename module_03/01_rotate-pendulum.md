In this lecture, you look at the virtual displacements and virtual work in a rotating reference frame. 

- For a system, with frame arms, $$a=1~m$$ and pendulum arm $$l=1~m$$, at what rotation rate will the system not oscillate? e.g. when natural frequency is $$0~rad/s$$?
- In a Newtonian system of equations, you would consider the reaction forces of every body. Why do we ignore virtual work for spinning, hinges, and other reactions?
