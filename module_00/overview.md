# Orientation

Welcome to Advanced Dynamics!

We are building a learning community around multibody dynamic systems.
We'll start off with one- and two-component systems working towards
computational tools to describe three- or more moving parts in dynamic
systems. 

This orientation has three goals:
1. Meet Prof. Cooper and review the course introduction
2. Introduce yourself on the discussion forum
3. Submit your first two assignments (HW_00 and Quiz_00)
