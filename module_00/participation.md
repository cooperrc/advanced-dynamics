# Participation 

This class is a community of practice for advanced engineering dynamics.
I expect that you participate in the course forum, watch posted videos,
and read the selected readings. 

 ## Online discussion 
  
 Be respectful, be helpful. We are coming into this course with different 
 levels of experience and different backgrounds. [Diversity creates 
 stronger research](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07415-9) 
 (Gewin _Nature_ 2018).  
  
 [Introduce yourself and discuss the course 
 here](https://campuswire.com/c/G34E5F12D/feed/1) 
  
 Continue posting questions and try to answer each other's questions. The 
 best way to learn is to communicate your interpretation and get 
 feedback. Let's create a welcoming community for us to discuss 
 engineering dynamics
