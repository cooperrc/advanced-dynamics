Dynamics is the study of how things move and interact. It sets the
foundation for almost every Mechanical engineering discipline: solid
mechanics, fluid mechanics, controls, vibrations, etc.
We are limiting our study to classical mechanics.  

We have four conditions for classical mechanics:
1. mass of objects is constant
2. mass of objects >> mass of atomic particles
3. velocity << speed of light
4. time is short (less than millenia) and mass is small (less than the
sun or black holes)

> Note: We won't consider quantum effects like wave-particle duality or
> relativistic effects. 

This course derives equations of motion for multibody systems using
__kinematics__ and __kinetics__. __Kinematics__ is the study of the
geometry of motion. __Kinetics__ is the study of forces, impacts, and
energy on objects.  Your goal is to build general equations of motion using [__Lagrange
equations__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics). We
will build the foundation for more advanced rigid body dynamic software
in Python. 

Course Calendar is in the [syllabus
