In this video, you see how to derive the equilibrium position of a complex system of parts. 

* The Lagrange equation is $\frac{\partial F}{\partial
  y}-\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial y'}\right) = 0$ for a
  _functional_, $F=F(x,y,y')$. Show that if $F = F(y,y')$, we can solve
  the first-order ODE: $F-y'\frac{\partial F}{\partial y'}=constant$ * 
* There are a lot of steps in solving an engineering problem like this.
  What are the main three outputs from these steps: 
    1. Define equations?
    2. Variational calculus (IBP and "trick")?
    3. solving the ODE?
