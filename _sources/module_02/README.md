# Module_02 - Variational methods
## Virtual work and virtual displacements

This module focuses on the underlying theory behind Lagrange's equations
of motion. Starting with the Hamilton's principle of least action, you
will derive the Lagrange equations of motion. In this module you will:

1. build a virtual model using virtual work and virtual displacements
2. solve for the shape of a hanging chain
3. create equations of motion using variational calculus
