# Module_01 - Definitions of motion
## Kinematics and degrees of freedom

This module focuses on core definitions in __kinematics__: _the geometry
of motion_. 

In this module you will

1. plot the motion of a linkage system
2. use reference frames to describe motion
3. define position, velocity, and acceleration in 2D and 3D reference
   frames
4. identify degrees of freedom and constraints on motion
5. construct reference frames to define position, velocity, and
   acceleration vectors in 2D and 3D
