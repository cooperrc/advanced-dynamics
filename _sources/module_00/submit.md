# Submitting and tracking your assignments

This course is designed to help you build a dynamics modeling portfolio.
You will build eight Jupyter notebooks throughout the semester that
demonstrate different models of motion, forces, and computational
approaches. You will also complete eight 20-minute quizzes based upon
the readings and lecture videos. 


## Portfolio-based grading

All of the work you do in this course is _yours_. You can publish it as
a website, you can share it with friends or colleagues, or use it to
build something new and interesting to _you_. You just need to
maintain the [creative commons
license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and add your own
intellectual ideas to the work. 

Learning management systems (LMS) are great for ranking and
critiquing your work, but the main feedback you receive is a list of
grades. In this course, you will maintain a Google Drive folder that
contains your projects, homeworks, and module learning objectives

## Creating your Advanced Dynamics portfolio
Go to this Drive link: [ME5180-_name_](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12NHCoeulToMyvpT5cqhOXAMHf4BNaByD?usp=sharing)
Follow the instructions in [Welcome to
ME5180](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lGb4M8sY2ukasardLZUM-qhe-VPkOERx/view?usp=sharing)
to make your own "ME5180-name" folder and share it with myself and the
TA. 

## Note on Python + Jupyter assignments

We (myself and the TA) will provide feedback on your homeworks and
quizzes. This course uses Python and Jupyter to build models of
multibody dynamic systems. Python and Jupyter are tools we use to make
engineering easier, they are _not_ meant to create new barriers to
engineering. If you receive errors, make mistakes, or just feel lost
programming, then share what you're trying to do and I am happy to
provide code that can be modified for your use case. You can also
resubmit work to improve your grade.
