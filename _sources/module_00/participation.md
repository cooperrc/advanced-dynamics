# Participation 

This class is a community of practice for advanced engineering dynamics.
I expect that you participate in the course forum, watch posted videos,
and read the selected readings. 

## Online discussion 

Be respectful, be helpful. We are coming into this course with different 
levels of experience and different backgrounds. [Diversity creates 
stronger research](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07415-9) 
(Gewin _Nature_ 2018).  

We should agree on _how_ we interact and assess your learning in this
first week. Use the course discussion forum to discuss changes to the
syllabus.

Continue posting questions and try to answer each other's questions. The 
best way to learn is to communicate your interpretation and get 
feedback. Let's create a welcoming community for us to discuss 
engineering dynamics
