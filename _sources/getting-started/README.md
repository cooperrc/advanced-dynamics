# Review materials for Physics and Python

This section has review materials for both physics and Python. We will
build equations of motion using the Lagrangian approach, but its helpful
to contrast this with the Newtonian, F=ma, approach. 

This section also has three chapters to help you get a feel for scientific
computing in Python with NumPy and Matplotlib. It is taken from
materials developed for ME3255 - Computational Mechanics.
