## [Lecture_05 - Spring pendulum equations](https://youtu.be/FslEE8pW4VE)


[![Spring pendulum notes](./01_spring-pendulum.png)](https://youtu.be/FslEE8pW4VE)

In this application of the Lagrange equations, you consider a pendulum
connected to an elastic spring. The system has two degrees of freedom
and two sources of potential energy. 

The video assumes a small angle approximation to linearize the equations
of motion. When would this assumption _not_ be valid?
