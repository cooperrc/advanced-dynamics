# Module_03 - Equations of motion
## Creating and solving Lagrangian equations

Thi  module focuses on creating and solving dynamic equations of motion
using variational calculus and the Lagrange equations. In this module
you will:

1. create a model of a pendulum in a rotating reference frame
2. build models with conservative and nonconservative forces
3. define kinetic and potential energy in an engineering system
4. create a model of a spinning top motion
