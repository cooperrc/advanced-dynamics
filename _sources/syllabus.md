# Dynamics
## ME 5180 Spring 2021

### Course Description
This is the study of moving objects and how they interact. We will explore
equations of motion using kinematics: the geometry of motion and kinetics: the
study of forces acting on objects. We will compare solving  problems
analytically and numerically using Newton's equations of motion and Lagrange's
equations of motion. 

### Course Expectations
Students are expected to understand modern physics techniques applied to single particles
and rigid body motion. Topics will include linear algebra, variational calculus, Lagrangian formulation,
work-energy relationships, moments and products of intertia, and solutions to ordinary
differential equations. The Lagrangian formulation will introduce variational calculus,
generalized coordinates, coordinate transformation, and generalized forces.
Numerical methods will introduce linear algebra and numerical integration. 

This course will introduce analytical and numerical solutions to multibody dynamic
systems. We will use Newton's laws of motion and Lagrange's laws
of motion, calculus, and linear algebra to derive differential equations of motion. We
will use [Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to analyze and
visualize solutions to dynamics problems. 

### Course Outcomes

Students will gain experience in creating and troubleshooting single and
multibody dynamic equation solvers. 

### Applications

- Automotive design: cam shafts, power requirements (both engine and brakes),
  windshield wipers, frame design, etc.

- Aerospace design: turbine blades, power requirements, flight tracking, etc. 

- Biomechanics design: artificial knees/hips/..., sports physics, health/fitness
  tracking, etc. 

- Sports: ball-tracking, speedometers, helmet design, equipment
  design (baseball bat, lacrosse stick,...),   etc.

## Academic Integrity: 
- The instructor of this class has a zero-tolerance policy for academic misconduct, that
  is copying others' work either in the lab, field, or on an exam.  Any student work that
  is found to be in violation of the university policy regarding academic misconduct
   will be assigned a grade of zero at a
  minimum.
- Read and understand [The UConn Student Code of
  Conduct](http://www.community.uconn.edu/student_code.html "The Student Code for Academic
  Integrity"). Students will follow all University regulations concerning the final exam.
