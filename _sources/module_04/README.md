# Module_04 - Computational Methods in Dynamics
## Constraints and motion

This module focuses on applying linear algebra and computational methods
to create general rigid body dynamics solutions. You will use
virtual work and virtual displacement to create computational approaches
to general dynamic system models. In this module you will:

1. build a model for a pin constraint
2. solve for the motion of a slider crank
3. choose computational tools to solve dynamics models
4. build a dynamic model pf a pendulum using computational models
5. demonstrate and recommend dynamic models
