In this lecture, you write out the kinematic constraints for 3 bodies moving in a planar system. You will explore the hands-on application in HW_07 _work-in-progress_. 

- What is the vector $\mathbf{Q}_d$ for a prismatic constraint that keeps an object sliding on a horizontal line?
- If you have one constraint function, $C=C(q_1,~q_2,~t) = q_1^2-3q_2$, what is the Jacobian, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{q}}$?
