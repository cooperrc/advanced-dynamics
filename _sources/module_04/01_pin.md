In this lecture, you build a framework to use pin constraints in a planar computational model. 

1. What is the benefit of creating a reusable constraint? as opposed to solving each dynamics problem analytically?
2. In the second example _2-pins and 2-arms_, what would an example of a set of constraints, $$\mathbf{C(q},t)$$, that would create a straight line of motion for the end of the second arm?
