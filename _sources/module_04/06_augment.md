In this video, you create the expanded _augmented technique_ to solve the dynamic _differential algebraic equations_ (DAE). Most multibody dynamic simulation tools use this equation form to set up and solve for the motion of dynamic systems. 

- What is a benefit/drawback between the _embedding_ and _augmented_ techniques?
