## Course Description
This is the study of moving objects and how they interact. We will explore
equations of motion using kinematics: the geometry of motion and kinetics: the
study of forces acting on objects. We will compare solving  problems
analytically and numerically using Newton's equations of motion and Lagrange's
equations of motion. 

## Course Expectations
Students are expected to understand modern physics techniques applied to single particles
and rigid body motion. Topics will include linear algebra, variational calculus, Lagrangian formulation,
work-energy relationships, moments and products of intertia, and solutions to ordinary
differential equations. The Lagrangian formulation will introduce variational calculus,
generalized coordinates, coordinate transformation, and generalized forces.
Numerical methods will introduce linear algebra and numerical integration. 

This course will introduce analytical and numerical solutions to multibody dynamic
systems. We will use Newton's laws of motion and Lagrange's laws
of motion, calculus, and linear algebra to derive differential equations of motion. We
will use [Python 3.8+](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to analyze and
visualize solutions to dynamics problems. 

## Course Outcomes

Students will 
1. Build engineering models of motion
2. Explain motion using vectors and calculus
3. Formulate equations of motion using variational calculus
4. Model motion of multibody engineering systems
5. Compare and contrast engineering models of motion

## Grading

| Item              | Percent | Requirement                   |
|-------------------|---------|-------------------------------|
| Homework          | 40 %    | Turn in homeworks by due date |
| Quizzes\*         | 40 %    | 8 quizzes                     |
| Participation\*\* | 20 %    | Self assessment               |

\* Note on Quizzes: Quizzes are based upon previous week's material.
They are open-resource. You should plan to spend 20-30 minutes
completing the quiz. You will submit a scan of your work
and a short (10-30 seconds) video to Classroom. 

\*\* Note on Participation: 
You can participate in a variety of ways e.g. 

1.  The videos are recorded lectures and tutorials. For each video, try
    to answer the discussion questions, or come up with your own. I
    encourage you to share your thoughts and questions on GitHub
    Discussions 
2. You can connect with other students and discuss the Homework and
   readings. You should dedicate at least 1 hour per week to reviewing
   content, so it helps to have others to talk through concepts
3. If you have another way you want to participate in the course,
   discuss that with Prof. Cooper.

### Due Dates and Late Policy

All course due dates are identified in the Google Calendar.
Deadlines are based on Eastern Time; if you are in a different time
zone, please adjust your submittal times accordingly. The instructor
reserves the right to change dates accordingly as the semester
progresses. *All changes will be communicated via the calendar or
another appropriate notification.*

**Late Policy:** If you need more time for an assignment or experience
technical difficulties, leave a note in the assignment submission with
two pieces of information:
1. What is your new submission date
2. What help do you need and how and you getting it (discussion post,
   colleague, Prof. Cooper, TA, etc.)?

The instructor can make accommodations for work, family, and personal
reasons. *We ask that you be respectful of the instructors' limited time
and resources.* 

### Feedback and Grades

I will make every effort to provide feedback and grades within 7 days.
To keep track of your performance in the course, refer to grades in
HuskyCT.


**Weekly Time Commitment**

You should expect to dedicate between 6 - 8 hours a week to this
course. This expectation is based on the various course activities,
assignments, and assessments and the University of Connecticut's policy
regarding credit hours. More information related to hours per week per
credit can be accessed at the [*Online Student
website*](https://onlinestudent.uconn.edu/learn-more/#collapsepanel-269-1-0-07).

This course requires *lots of practice*. You should set aside 6-8 hours
per week (assuming a 5-day work-week) to write out example problems from
the textbook, try homework problems, and revise answers. This is the
best way to prepare for quizzes.


## Academic Integrity: 
- The instructor of this class has a zero-tolerance policy for academic misconduct, that
  is copying others' work either in the lab, field, or on an exam.  Any student work that
  is found to be in violation of the university policy regarding academic misconduct
   will be assigned a grade of zero at a
  minimum.
- Read and understand [The UConn Student Code of
  Conduct](http://www.community.uconn.edu/student_code.html "The Student Code for Academic
  Integrity"). Students will follow all University regulations concerning the final exam.
