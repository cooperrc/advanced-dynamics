In this lecture, you write out the kinematic constraints for 3 bodies moving in a planar system. You will explore the hands-on application in HW_07 _work-in-progress_. 

- What is the vector $$\mathbf{Q}_d$$ for a prismatic constraint that keeps an object sliding on a horizontal line?
- If you have one constraint function, $$C=C(q_1,~q_2,~t) = q_1^2-3q_2$$, what is the Jacobian, $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{q}}$$?
