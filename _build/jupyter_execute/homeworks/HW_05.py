# ![Whirling Roller-coaster](../images/roller_coaster.svg)
# 
# A roller coaster is being designed on a parabolic track that rotates at a constant
# speed as seen in the figure above. Assume the cart rolls on the track as a frictionless
# point-mass of 100-kg. Determine the equations of motion in terms of the distance from the
# lowest point, $q_1=x_2$. 
# 
#   a. What is the kinetic energy of the cart?
# 
#   b. What is the potential energy of the cart?
# 
#   c. What is the equation of motion for the cart?
# 
# ## 1. Create a function, `cart_ode`, that represents the equation of motion for the car in terms of $x_2$

# In[2]:


def cart_ode(t,r,w):
    '''
    cart_ode(t,r,w)
    
    Set of 2 ODEs that return dx2/dt and d^2x2/dt^2 with input
    x2 and dx2/dt, dr/dt = f(t,r)
    Parameters
    ----------
    t: current time
    r: current state [x, dx]
    w: system rotation rate [rad/s]
    Returns
    -------
    dy: derivative of current state [dx, ddx]
    '''
    dr=np.zeros(np.shape(r))
    dr[0] = r[1]
    dr[1] #= ... your equation here
    return dr


# ## 2. Solve the `cart_ode` initial value problem for x(0)=10 m, dx/dt(0)=0 m/s and $\omega$=0 rad/s

# In[3]:


x0=10
v0=0
w=0 # rad/s
end_time=10 # choose an end time that displays one full period

r0 = solve_ivp(lambda t,r: cart_ode(t,r,w),[0, end_time],[x0,v0])


# ## 3. Solve the `cart_ode` initial value problem for x(0)=3 m, dx/dt(0)=0 m/s and $\omega$=1 rad/s

# In[4]:


x0=10
v0=0
w=3
end_time=10 # choose an end time that displays one full period

r1 = solve_ivp(lambda t,r: cart_ode(t,r,w),[0, end_time],[x0,v0])


# ## 4. Solve the `cart_ode` initial value problem for x(0)=3 m, dx/dt(0)=0 m/s and $\omega$=2 rad/s

# In[5]:


x0=10
v0=0
w=6
end_time=10 # choose an end time that displays one full period

r2 = solve_ivp(lambda t,r: cart_ode(t,r,w),[0, end_time],[x0,v0])


# ## 5. Plot the three solutions together
