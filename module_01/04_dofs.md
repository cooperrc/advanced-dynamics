This video covers some concepts about how to describe a system with moving parts:
1. degrees of freedom
2. generalized coordinates

These two concepts are very important in Lagrangian dynamics. 

* What are other constraints in dynamic systems (others than hinges and prismatic joints)?
* How would you describe the constraints on the Ex. 1 pendulum? Why is there only one degree of freedom?
