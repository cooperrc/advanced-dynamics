Variational calculus is similar to calculus. In calculus, you can find
the minimum and maximum of a function, $f(x)$ by setting
$\frac{df}{dx}=0$. 

In variational calculus, we are seeking the the function, $f(x)$, that
minimizes a _functional_ that may be a function of
$E=E(x,~f,~\frac{df}{dx})$. 

How could we use this tool to solve an applied physics problem
(dynamics, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, etc.)? _choose a specific
example_

What work and energy would you minimize for a dynamics problem?
