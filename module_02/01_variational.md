Variational calculus is similar to calculus. In calculus, you can find the minimum and maximum of a function, $$f(x)$$ by setting $$\frac{df}{dx}=0$$. 

In variational calculus, we are seeking the the function, $$f(x)$$, that minimizes a _functional_ that may be a function of $$E=E(x,~f,~\frac{df}{dx})$$. 

How could we use this tool to solve an applied physics problem (dynamics, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, etc.)? _choose a specific example_

What work and energy would you minimize for a dynamics problem?
